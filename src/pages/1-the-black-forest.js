    <h1>1. The Black Forest</h1>
    <h2>Aubry</h2>
    <p>It’d been a cruel winter, but finally, the ice was melting.</p>
    <p>
      The signs of the seven-month freeze were still evident in Aubry’s shaky
      fingers as she laced her boots, the dirty-looking circles smeared beneath
      her brown eyes. Starvation and frostbite gripped the small mountain town
      of Ledak in a vice, but with the melt came the promise of good hunting.
      She pocketed a small knife from her bedside table and rubbed her hands
      together to stave off the morning chill before reaching for the door.

      Aubry fingers tying shoes, or sunken eyes
    </div>

    <p>
      Downstairs, it was frigid and silent as a crypt, pale streaks of dust
      hanging still in air. She could hear voices coming from outside, and
      through a window glazed in white frost, could see the silhouettes of men
      against the morning light. She squinted at their blurry outlines through
      the window, trying hopelessly to do a headcount. Five, maybe six?
    </p>
    <p>
      Aubry had to heave the front door open with both hands for it to break
      free of the ice. The world was completely white for several moments as her
      eyes adjusted, then the jagged outline of the Black Forest and the peaks
      of the Tian Ma broke through the mist. Her first breath of air was so cold
      that a searing pain spread through her lungs, making her cough and pull a
      bandana over her nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Men that Aubry had never seen before were standing around in the
      snow-covered front lawn, wearing heavy cloaks trimmed with rabbit fur.
      Expensive clothes, much nicer than anything anyone wore around here. Her
      eyes lingered on their soft leather boots, now encrusted in snow and ice
      before she pressed on to find her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’d snowed overnight, making the trek around the house particularly
      difficult. Even wearing snow boots, her feet easily went ankle-deep
      through pockets of snow. She was panting by the time she found her father,
      who was lacing heavy bags of grain to the wooly sides of a mountain yak.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The lordlings aren’t with ya, are they?” he said, without looking up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aubry looked over her shoulder, where she could see the men punting hard
      balls of snow back and forth. Now that she could see them clearly, she
      counted seven in all. One of them was hit in the neck by a snowball and
      ran after his attacker with a raised knife.
    </p>
    <p>“Are they really lords?”</p>
    <p>
      “Lords, <i>shah’s</i>, I don’t pretend to keep track. More boys from down
      south, just like every year,” he said, adding with a small shrug. “
      <i>Turistas.</i>”
    </p>
    <p>Tourists.</p>
    <p>
      Aubry walked around the yak to get a better look at the supplies. Grain
      and rolled grass bales were lashed around the animals back, alongside
      sacks of beans and bacon rashers and wolf furs. Balanced on a makeshift
      wooden saddle, they were all signs of an impending trek into the woods,
      and quite a lengthy one by the looks of things.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Where do they want to go?” said Aubry, helping secure a leather girth
      around the animals midriff. It snorted, but kept digging through the snow
      in search of grass, unperturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her fathers sweaty face appeared over the animals wither. He had jet black
      hair and a graying beard, but had never lost the muscle from his youth.
      Spending most of his time guiding hunters through the treacherous Tian Ma
      kept them both lean as dogs. He glanced over her shoulder to double-check
      that their clientelle were well out of earshot.

      “The Gokyo Ri,” he said. "Although, speakin truthfully, I dunno if they’ll
      even make it as far as the pass,” he frowned, but there was a touch of
      amusement in his voice. “I mean. Have you seen them?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Aubry turned over her shoulder to see snowballs flying through the air so
      thick, it looked like fog. Guffaws of laughter cut through the air between
      the breaks in conversation. She watched their boots sink to the knee, and
      the ensuing dance as they shook snow out of their shoes, and wondered how
      long it would take for the first signs of frostbite.
    </p>
    <p>
      “How do they even know about the canyon?” said Aubry, the surprise in her
      voice obvious. The Gokyo Ri was a near-verticle slot canyon that was
      periolous anytime of year, but during the snowmelt it had a reputation for
      being downright deadly. A frigid gust of wind blew past, breaking the
      silence with a low howl. “Why not go to Shiva Altes? If they're trying to
      take a wolf, or a bear.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father shook his head. “They’re following the herds, got it in their
      head that that’s where they want to go,” he shrugged. “And their money’s
      good, so who are we to argue?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Aubry’s mouth drew into a thin line, but she didn’t say anything. The
      herds of Markhorein that roamed the Tian Ma attracted similar clientelle
      every spring, their coiled antlers and lion-like manes and tails appearing
      only in glimpses through the dense woodlands as they descended the rocky
      cliffs for the grassy meadows that bloomed in the springtime, fed by
      melting snow. The upperclass traveled as far as the Royal City for the
      opportunity to bring down one of the beasts themselves, spurred on by
      local legends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three more yaks were leaden down with supplies and pack harnesses, their
      long fur blowing like a skirt in the wind. They bobbed their heads up and
      down at the same moment Aubry heard crunches of snow and turned to see the
      lordlings walking toward them. Her father had met the boys in town, she
      knew that much. He’d told her the night before to expect them, but that
      was all she knew.

    <p>“Where’d they even come from?”</p>

    <p>
      “Probably the Royal City, same as the rest,” said her father, nodding at
      the dark blue tint of their cloaks, even in the sunlight. "That’s the
      right colors, anyway. Magicerene blue, I'd recognize it anywhere. I still
      remember the factories that made the stuff in town, stinks to high
      heaven." Wiping sweat from his brow with a dirty rag, her father waved at
      them convivally, plastering a smile on his face.
    </p>
    <p>“Mornin, boys. Fine day for a little walk in the woods, isn’t it?”</p>
    <p>
      “Perhaps,” said a serious-looking man with black hair and a long, flowing
      cloak. He wore a sash over one shoulder and Aubry could see a fine blade
      protruding from a scabbard at his waist. Her eyes lingered on a circle of
      glittering blue stones inlaid into the handle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another man walked beside him, although he looked much younger, he had a
      heavy-looking rifle strapped to one shoulder. Wisps of red hair were
      visible under the hood of his cloak, which was even finer than his
      friends. Trimmed in blond wolf fur and decorated in silver buttons, it
      gave him an air of regality that his face alone did not posess. silver

    <p>“How far to the pass?” said the older of the two.</p>
    <p>
      “We’ll make it tonight and lay camp, the herds wont descend til morning.”
    </p>
    <p>“How sure are you that we’ll even find them? The woods are endless.”</p>
    <p>
      Her father smiled disarmingly. “Been doing this since before you were
      born, lad. You leave that part to me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      He stared at her father suspiciously, searching his face for any hint of
      mistruth, before his friend clapped him on the shoulder and smiled in an
      effort to break the tension.
    </p>
    <p>“What’s the matter, Elsa? Sounds alright to me.”</p>
    <p>
      The man, who was apparently called Elsa, turned to his friend and said, “I
      don’t like these woods, <i>shahzade</i>. I’ve heard the stories. Trust me,
      one night in the Black Forest is a night too many.”
    </p>
    <p>“But where’s your sense of adventure?”</p>
    <p>
      “Must’ve left it back at the palace, along with my sandals and my good
      mood,” he sniffed, turning back to her father with an outstretched glove.
      “Alright, then. One night.”
    </p>
    <p>
      "Astly Fauchard," beamed her father, before turning back to finish tacking
      up. "And don't believe all the stories, it's just trees, same as any other
      wood."

        Before Aubry knew it, they were wheeling out of the driveway, snow
        spraying the streets on either side of the yaks. It was still early in
        the morning, and they passed no one on their way out of town. The only
        signs of life were the tendrils of smoke curling from the tiny hamlet of
        Ledak, and the ocassional pastured steer.

        The ancient, dark pines of the Black Forest loomed over them, seemingly
        as tall as mountains. Heavy mists pooled around the trunks already piled
        with snow, obscuring everything. Slipping through the treeline felt like
        passing through a curtain to another world entirely, on one side the
        quiet village of Ledak, and on the other, all of nature’s stage.

      <p style={{ color: `white` }}>
        Although she was small and scrawny, Aubry was fast and strong and easily
        kept up with Marten in the woods. Having spent most of her time back
        home racing up and down the uneven stone streets of Carvalo with her
        friends, the knobbly undergrowth of the Black Forest was a welcome
        challenge. It’d taken her a little while to get used to wearing boots
        with metal spikes in them, but now she could scale the snowy ridges with
        the ease of a goat.
      </p>
      <p style={{ color: `white` }}>
        It was a long walk on a familiar trail, the snow already packed to ice.
        Her father lead the lordlings deeper into the woods, slipping and
        sinking into the snow, while Aubry brought up the rear, nothing but the
        sound of their own footsteps setting a steady pace through the woods. It
        was eerily quiet in the Black Forest, winter blotting out the familiar
        sounds of animals or insects. The near-permanent fog dampened everything
        from the suns rays, to the sound of their own breathing, and the trees
        grew so close together that even the echo of their voices were absorbed.
      </p>
      <p style={{ color: `white` }}>“How’d you even find this place?”</p>
      <p style={{ color: `white` }}>
        “Everything needs water to survive, the animals, us,” her father was
        picking out a path where chunks of tree trunks had been cut away by a
        machete, a crude system for marking the trail. “There’s snow everywhere,
        but they’re all attracted to flowing water. In the summer it’s a little
        more perilous, as the banks flood, and during the winter half the river
        freeezs over, so what you’re really waiting for is the melt.”
      </p>
      <p style={{ color: `white` }}>
        After a while, Aubry could hear the crush of falling water, and she knew
        that they were near the canyon. The trees thinned and they found
        themselves overlooking the first waterfall of the canyon. Glimmering
        black stone, dusted with snow and icicles plunged hundreds of feet into
        impenetrable fog. It was another hour of hiking down to the base of the
        falls, and another hour after that before they reached the wider, calmer
        banks where they could set up camp and wait.

    <p>"Do you see that?" said Elsa, pointing across the gorge.</p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, everyone was alert. Aubry scanned the sheer cliffs for any signs
      of life, before she felt a hand on her shoulder. Her father was at her
      side, kneeling in the snow and urging everyone else to do the same.
    </p>
    <p>"Get down!" he whispered.</p>
    <p>
      Aubry knew by now that the herds of Markhorein - large mountain goats
      indigenous to the Tian Ma - rarely strayed this close to the edge of the
      Black Forest. The Gokyo Ri was too exposed and open to attract the herds
      when there were plenty of quiet, tucked away crevasses deep in the
      mountains to hide in, and few other animals could brave the treacherous
      ledges of the slot canyon besides them.

      They followed the river downstream when then they heard a low noise, like
      the rattling of an engine. Marten stopped in his tracks before throwing
      out an arm so quickly that Aubry was knocked backwards. The old man
      whirled on her, one finger pressed urgently against his lip. He mouthed
      shush, but no words came out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The noise came again, accompanied by a competing hiss. Crouched down in
      the snow, the cold penetrated everything, her fingers and toes freezing
      even through thick leather. It sounded like a pair of fighting dogs.
      Another loud growl sent several birds soaring out of the canyon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aubry’s skin went a degree paler when she got a good look around the
      boulders. It wasn’t dogs making all the racket — it was two large beasts
      circling eachother in the snow. From this distance, they almost looked
      human, except for the pattern of gray spots that trailed down their spine
      and their long, pearl-white tails.

    <p>
      One of them, the larger of the two, had eight plush mountain hares thrown
      over his shoulder. Aubry could see their noses, streaked with bright red
      blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      She’d never seen such creatures outside of books, but the sight of them
      made a chill spread through Aubry that had nothing to do with the cold.
      Slowly, she backtracked through the woods, reaching instinctively for her
      knife. Her vision was blurry, but the pleasant warm sensation brought on
      by the <i>kalakatta</i> had evaporated.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, the beasts had long gone, and the idea that they could be out
      there in the forest frightened her much more than seeing them in person.
      They could be anywhere. Blending into the shadows, prowling flat against
      the snow. As quickly as they’d appeared, they were gone, melting into
      mists like the legends after which they were named.
