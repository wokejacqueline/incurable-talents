    <h1>2. Shahzade</h1>
    <h2>Elsavere</h2>
    <p>
      Elsavere wheeled a spotted mule to a halt in front of a long red wall,
      heavy iron gates already sliding open to greet him. He’d ridden with three
      other men from the Honour Guard, which rode up the trail behind him in a
      wagon strapped with large wooden barrels of water. He raised his forearm
      against a glare of sunlight peeking over the ramparts, a dark blue cloak
      whipping around his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>"Commander!"</p>
    <p>
      There was a clatter like horse hooves, then a boy emerged from behind the
      wall with cloven hooves where his feet should’ve been. Elsavere stiffened,
      casting around for guardsmen - or literally anyone else - as the boy took
      hold of his mule’s reins. Elsavere noted the short antlers that protruded
      from the sides of his skull when he bowed, unable to look away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We hadn’t expected you for a few weeks still," said the boy. "But we're
      thrilled to have you, of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      More of them emerged, dressed in silk kameezol and silver collars, clearly
      slaves, but so strange to see up close that he couldn’t stop staring. No
      two were completely alike, their coats in varying shades of brown, but
      they were so humanlike that the sight of their ears and tails were
      uncanny.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elsavere’s spine went very rigid as they were lead through a dim tunnel
      bored straight through the wall. Some two hundred feet long and as wide as
      two carriages, even the cool air did not give him comfort. He could not
      take his mind off the sound of echoing hooves, almost double now that they
      were accompanied by whatever strange creatures the Alsaints called these.
    </p>
    <p>
      He never wanted to come to Natans, but as the princes hunting party had
      journeyed to Ledak going on a month ago now, and it was impossible to pass
      the Natansi desert without getting more water, Natans was located at the
      halfway point between the deserts edge and the foothills of the Tian Ma.
    </p>
    <p>
      Built at the base of a natural canyon, the compound was a sprawling
      military base made of thick red stone and smokestacks that few had ever
      seen or heard of. Part of the military's joint venture with the Alsaints,
      the base was like an oasis to those who knew where to look in the shifting
      golden sands of the Natansi desert, but Elsavere still didn't trust it.
    </p>
    <p>
      After nearly a week in the saddle across hostile desert terrain, he could
      hear birdsong and see mottled light spilling into a stone courtyard, and
      it still did nothing for his nerves. He could never be sure what secret
      projects the Alsaints were working on, but he'd seen enough of their
      creations to be wary of them.
    </p>
    <p>“Elsa!”</p>
    <p>
      Being a military man and now in his thirties, commander Elsavere winced at
      the nickname, but he recognized the voice. A man whom he recognized, with
      rust-brown hair and a dark beard, was grinning at him from the shade of a
      grove of fragrant pear trees.
    </p>
    <p>“How was the journey?”</p>
    <p>
      “Awful, hot, nothing to see,” said Elsavere, swinging out of his saddle
      while one of the deerlike creatures gathered the reins. “And at the end of
      it all, I end up here, with you. And whatever you call these things.”
    </p>
    <p>
      He gestured to the slaves and the man beside him laughed, the sound
      echoing as the horses were lead away. Elsavere picked stray bits of fur
      off of his cloak, dusted off his trousers.
    </p>
    <p>"The animals? "They're dead useful."</p>
    <p>
      "I can't believe you just let them just walk around," said Elsavere,
      incredulous. "What does Charle think?"
    </p>
    <p>
      At this the man supressed a smile and embraced Elsavere, who eventually
      dropped his stiff posture and gave his brother a clap on the back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Suppose you'll see for yourself," he shrugged. "It's good to see you,
      brother." His brothers smile faltered, then returned as he stepped from
      the shade of the pear trees, closing the gap between them. "You'll be
      wanting a hot shower right about now, I bet?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where's Charle?" said Elsavere. He didn't want to be at Natans any longer
      than he had to be. If it were up to him, he would've taken twice the
      amount of water and crossed the Natansi desert with his men rather than
      stop here. But Charle had insisted they'd be able to get them to Ledak
      faster if they stopped, so they stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the airhangar, probably," said Gingi. Joint projects with the Land
      Army kept the Alsaints busy building secret vehicles and weapons year alr
      round, but Elsavere knew about the airhangar already. The Alsaints had
      been building their ship for a long time, since he was a boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hot shower will do you some good," said Gingi, and although Elsavere
      thought to argue, he didn't. It'd been a long journey, and although he
      hated being in the anonymous concrete walls of Natans, he longed for its
      human comforts. After some deliberating, he allowed himself to be shown
      into the main building, where similar huge slabs of carved brick made up
      each echoing chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unlike the Royal Palace, and the other houses he'd visited in Tehrine and
      Saryn, Natans had no decorative tiles, no carved archways. Instead, the
      compound was a twisting maze of squared-off corridors, the ceilings low
      and the sounds all but muted by the heavy slabs of stone. Iron support
      beams ran through the ceiling in places, and each time Elsavere passed
      through a doorway, he was reminded that the walls were at least three feet
      thick.
    </p>
    <p>
      The few windows in the compound were narrow and offered a slim view of the
      desert sky outside, now growing dark and scattered with stars. Intricate
      lanters hung on the walls at intervals, glowing with a strange blue light
      that Elsavere knew to be one of the many Alsaint discoveries that lead to
      Natans' existence in the first place.
    </p>

    </div>

    <p>
      He was lead to one of the many apartments that branched off the compound,
      reserved exclusively for officers and left alone. The room was darkly
      luxurious, with a large tapestry on the wall depicting the Alsaints seal,
      a lion seized by vines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elsavere found a glassed-in shower and turned the spigot to a fountain of
      hot water, one of the many Alsaint advancements that made his time at
      Natans tolerable. He was covered from head to toe in silt and sand from
      his trip through the desert, and when he glimpsed his reflection in the
      mirror, he saw that the sun had only partly tanned his wrists and neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Alsaints were responsible for a number of fantastical inventions,
      including the cool burning blue lights, pipes for moving water, and a
      variety of sweet fruits and vegetables engineered in the gardens. It
      wasn't enough to call the Alsaints scientists, they were creators of a
      different sort, revered as godlike among the people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elsavere stepped out of the shower to pleasantly warmed concrete floors
      and plush rolled towels on the counter. He'd actually spent a good deal of
      time at Natans growing up. After his parents died on the frontlines, he
      and his siblings had been taken in by the Alsaints to grow up at the
      compound.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was glad to fulfill his service to the Honour Guard. When he was
      fourteen, he left Natans to join the Land Army as all orphan boys his age
      must, but his special skill with a blade made him an ideal candidate for a
      special division of the Land Army's soldiers, charged with protecting the
      royal family.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was only five years older than the crown prince, and at the time of his
      enrollment and subsequent transfer to the Land Army, he'd begun to spend a
      lot of time at the Royal Palace. Getting to know the prince had proved to
      be something of a double-edged sword for Elsavere, who was now in charge
      of protecting the prince.
    </p>
    <p>Easier said than done.</p>
    <p>
      He rummaged through his bag for his dark blue roughspun and toweled the
      water from his hair. He'd forgotten how tired he was, but the water seemed
      to coax the soreness from his bones. It was nearly dark, the narrow
      windows in his apartment offering him a view of the rim of the canyon, now
      nearly black against the deep blue pitch of the night sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      A knock at the door broke his concentration, and a moment later he was
      looking at a womans moonlit face, red braid of hair cascading down a
      shoulder clad in layers of brightly colored fabric. It was his sister,
      Charlevere, whom he hadn't seen in going on a year, now that he was in
      full service to the royal family.
    </p>
    <p>"Elsavere, it's been too long," she said fondly.</p>
    <p>
      "Yeah, well, let's not get too familiar," Elsavere replied. He was still
      keen to put as much distance between himself and the compound as possible,
      but Charlevere only smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had that way about her, easy smiles and a soft laugh. She'd grown to
      be both taller and more eloquent than both of her siblings. After their
      parents died, it was the oldest child who naturally took over the families
      affairs. There'd been doubters as to whether or not Charlever was up to
      the task, but she proved to have a special prowess for politics. In only
      four years time, she'd successfully joined the forces of the Alsaints with
      the Land Army, and directly controls their largest joint project to date.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have something for me?" said Elsavere, earnest to cut through the
      smalltalk. His sister was educated and could keep conversations going for
      hours, a trait that was not lost even on him.
    </p>
    <p>"Oh, that," she smiled. "Are you so eager to leave?"</p>
    <p>
      Elsavere didn't respond. He didn't need to. Charlevere knew as well as
      anyone his reluctance for being at Natans, so she simply shrugged and
      said. "Put on something warm, the desert gets cold as the Tian Ma at
      night."
    </p>
    <p>
      She left him, but it wasn't long for Elsavere to appear at the door
      dressed in the same dark blue uniform he'd arrived in. He inclined his
      head slightly, as close to a bow as he would ever get when it came to his
      own sister, but she instead rushed him in a hug.
    </p>
    <p>"Any word from Charles?" said Charle.</p>
    <p>
      Elsavere shook his head. "They should've arrived at the base sometime ago,
      but we've yet to get word back from Ledak."
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing his sisters knit eyebrows, he added. "Although, I wouldn't
      immediately view this as cause for concern. Even the men we send up north
      miss there arrival by a day or two, with the weather and all that."
    </p>
    <p>"Still," said Charle, echoing Elsavere's thoughts exactly.</p>
    <p>
      They were in another of Natans's eerie, anonymous corridors when Charle
      lifted a lantern from the wall, carrying it by a heavy bronze ring. A blue
      glow emanated around them, casting their shadows far ahead of their
      bodies. The corridor extended straight for sometime, decorated only with
      other heavy wooden doors that Elsavere knew to be officers quarters. They
      were let out in the main hall, the distant sounds of machinery still
      audible even at this hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, the sooner we get back on the road the better, in any case," said
      Elsavere as the main doors were opened by a system of mechanical chains.
    </p>
    <p>"That's exactly why I've called you here," said Charle seriously.</p>
    <p>
      They crossed the courtyard, which still smelled of fragrant pear and
      orange blossoms. In the distance, Elsavere could see bright blue lights
      emanating from the windows of a brick building, brighter than any fire
      he'd ever seen. But they were going the opposite way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elsavere turned to look over his shoulder. "Charle, what's over there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They're still working on it," she said, doing little to assuage
      Elsavere's curiosity. He was about to say, <i>"Working on what?"</i> but
      no sooner had another large building loomed into view. Dark pillars
      pumping out stacks of white steam into the night sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elsavere was so fixated on the smokestacks that he didn't even notice the
      black-painted pasture fences lining either side of the walkway until a
      dimly-lit horse took off, little more than a clatter of hoofbeats in the
      dark. Charle raised her lantern to see the horse just as it disappeared to
      the other side of the pasture, decorative feathers still tied to its tail.
    </p>
    <p>"You guys really prepared for my arrival, huh?"</p>
    <p>"It was for the crown prince," said Charle icily.</p>
    <p>
      Before Elsavere could continue, they arrived at the steps of a much
      smaller building, lit with the same blue lanterns. He realized that the
      smokestacks were actually much further away than they appeared, and by the
      smell of hay and manure in the air, they were entering some sort of
      stable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Elsavere stopped to get one last look at the smokestacks. Three in all,
      they protruded from the darkness like nothing he had ever seen before. He
      pointed. "Is that-?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The refinery?" his sister said, her tone sliding toward annoyance. "Yes,
      now come on. It's freezing."
    </p>
    <p>
      The stable was dark, dry, and gloriously warm. Almost immediately, Charle
      threw off the hood of her long jacket and raised her lantern.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fresh horses?" said Elsavere. Now it was his turn to be annoyed. "We'll
      stick with the mules, they're hardier and last better in Natansi."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charlevere didn't respond. Instead, she lead Elsavere deeper into the
      stable, the glow of the lantern illuminating her in a silvery glow.
      Against his better judgement, Elsavere followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had to squint to see, but he wasn't sure his eyes weren't playing
      tricks on him. He could see horses in the dark, but they were unlike any
      horses he'd ever seen before. With long feathers growing from their manes
      and tails, and some of them which even had wings protruding from their
      body.
    </p>
    <p>"What are these?"</p>
    <p>
      "The Alsaints latest creation," said Charlevere. "Now, you'll be able to
      cross the Natans desert in half the time."
