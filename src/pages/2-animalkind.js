      <h1>2. Animalkind</h1>
      <h2>Aubre</h2>
      <p>
        Aubre watched the crown prince’s guards load the beast into the back of
        the <i>hurcha</i>, a small wood cart with a short bed, hitched to a team
        of three woolly yaks.
      </p>

      <p>
        Although she'd accompanied her father into the Black Forest many times
        before, she’d never seen any creature quite like it. The animal was only
        a little bigger than she was, but it looked more like a person in a
        heavy coat than anything she’d ever seen in the woods. Its legs, arms
        and even torso looked like her own, and except for a long tail and
        charcoal-gray fur, it could have been some strange, vestigial human
        ancestor.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Look at it’s fangs,” said the prince, grinning with one boot on the
        back of the cart as two men in dark blue cloaks hauled the creature up
        for him. Curved canine teeth were partly exposed where its mouth hung
        open, and blood stained the fur on its thigh where the bullet had
        struck.
      </p>

      <p>
        A man dressed in heavy leathers put one hand on the princes shoulder,
        prizing him away from the animals face with non-negotiable firmness.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Anyone ever tell you not to stand behind a horse, son?” he said, but he
        was easily brushed off as the prince went on with his retelling of what
        had happened, the facts stretching precariously thin.
      </p>
      <p>
        They were on their second day into their trek to Bushkehr, the lumber
        yard some forty miles outside town, when the prince had seen the
        creatures slinking along a ledge above them. Aubre barely had time to
        look up and see a long spotted tail - which at the time she thought was
        a frozen treelimb - when a deafening gunshot echoed through the canyon.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her ears were <i>still</i> ringing from the blast.
      </p>
      <p>
        “If I hadn't seen the beast sneaking around in the shadows, it would
        have been upon us,” he said dramatically. “Clouds covering everything.
        It must have been two hundred meters, and in a complete white-out.”
      </p>
      <p>
        "A keen eye and fine marksmanship, <i>shahzade</i>,” one of his men
        agreed, using the prince’s formal title as he knotted a makeshift rope
        collar around the beasts throat. An extra precaution. Like the other
        uniformed guard that'd accompanied him, the man seemed uneasy to be
        around the creature, but the prince would not allow another shot be
        fired.
      </p>
      <p>
        “You’ll ruin the pelt if you keep putting holes in it,” he'd complained
        after seeing it in the ravine, and now peered over the small wooden
        wagon at the crimson stain in the animals fur with a frown.
      </p>
      <p>
        “You should listen to your men,” Aubre’s father warned, pulling an
        ice-flecked bandana over his face as the wind picked up. "It was clearly
        stalking us, and it's deformed, diseased. You should leave it in the
        ravine, where it fell."
      </p>
      <p>
        The prince scoffed at his superstition, but before he could get another
        word in, her father trudged off to tend to the yaks. Dressed in patchy
        rabbit furs corded together with strips of leather, it was clear that
        Astly Fauchard was annoyed at arguing with a boy only a third of his
        age, regardless of title.
      </p>
      <p>
        His imposing figure was a well-known one in Ledak. Once a soldier in the
        Land Army and now retired, he'd moved to the small mountain town to
        raise his daughter after the war, and now only did work as a guide in
        the spring and summer, when the weather wasn't as punishing.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the crown prince and his men arrived in Ledak asking for passage to
        Bushkehr, her father didn't ask questions, merely set a price. Aubre had
        barely ever heard anyone mention the lumber yard in conversation before.
        She only knew of it because of the stream of soldiers that she'd seen
        floating heavy logs down the river Choy Oyo in the spring since she was
        young. She'd never been there herself, and had no idea what a crown
        prince would want with a lumber yard this far away from the Royal City,
        but she'd never met a prince before, and she'd been eager to accompany
        them on the journey all the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of the time, life in Ledak was quiet, the land almost perpetually
        blanketed by thick snow. The most exciting thing Aubre looked forward to
        each month was trading furs and meats in the center of town from their
        hunting trips in the woods. It was the only time she ever saw other
        children her own age, which there were so few of in the town that there
        wasn't even a school.
      </p>
      <p>
        She jogged to catch up with her father. Even though she was already
        sixteen years old, she was small and scrawny and wore her hair cropped
        close, like a boys. The harsh half-year winters in the Tian Ma kept her
        lean as a hunting dog, and despite being bundled in layers of fur and
        leather, it was obvious by the hollows under her eyes and the sharp
        slope of her cheekbones that she was rail thin.
      </p>
      <p>
        She helped check the yak’s harnesses while her father looked ahead at
        where the canyon coiled back into the gloom of the forest.
      </p>
      <p>“What’s wrong?”</p>
      <p>
        She’d never seen him so distracted. In the forest he was always focused,
        noticing even the smallest change in the yaks gait, snow crunching
        through the evergreens, a rifle perpetually close at hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I've seen beasts like that before,” he said quietly, his tone wavering
        in an unusual display of concern. "Back in the Land Army."
      </p>
      <p>"What?"</p>
      <p>
        Aubre was surprised to hear him say this. He almost never talked about
        his life before she was born, especially his days in the military. Her
        dark eyes searched the walls of the canyon, suddenly unable to shake the
        foreboding feeling that’d come over her as the yaks strained at their
        harnesses, seeming as eager to leave the frozen river as they were.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I thought it was just sickly, you know how sometimes deer antlers grow
        crooked when the winters don’t let up early enough,” Aubre murmured,
        more to herself than anyone. “<i>Shahzade</i> did it a kindness.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Different kind of sickness," he said, staring ahead pensively. "And
        even so, what do we do with the sick? Leave them where they lie. Not
        take them home to hang in the trophy room!"
      </p>
      <p>
        Aubre looked over her shoulder at where the prince and his guards were
        now squeezing into the small covered cabin. Out here, the rugged
        landscape reigned supreme, and they could nfot tolerate the frigid cold
        for long. When they stopped to make camp the night before, it was
        misery, with only a small fire and no luxuries, not even a spoon to
        scrape their meals of warmed <i>tsempe</i> - balls of yaks butter,
        coated in a thick layer of toasted barley - out of the cast iron.
      </p>
      <p>
        "The Alsaints called them <i>Animalkind</i>," her father continued,
        lowering his voice as if merely mentioning the beasts would draw them
        out into the open.
      </p>
      <p>"What are they?" said Aubre.</p>
      <p>
        "Abominations," her father replied. "Human-animal hybrids, some of the
        Alsaints earliest creations after they learned to control their magic.
        They told us the creatures were functionally extinct, after we razed
        Natansi. But this one looks young, a juvenile yet."
      </p>
      <p>
        Aubre blinked, turning the word over in her mind. <i>Animalkind? </i>
        She’d never heard of it before, not even from passing travelers. She
        looked again toward the
        <i> hurcha</i>, and the walls of the canyon beyond. The Black Forest
        stretched across the entire Tian Ma mountain range, thousands of miles
        of steep and unforgiving wilderness. They'd turned up strange creatures
        hunting before, but who knew what its depths truly held?
      </p>
      <p>“We could follow the river out west,” her father was saying. </p>
      <p>
        Aubre only had a rough knowledge of the Gokyo Ri, but she knew it ended
        at the grassy steppes of the mountains, where its rocky slopes dissolved
        into scrub grass, before meeting the golden sands of the Natansi desert.
        If they went that way, at least they would be out in the open, with no
        dense foliage to be ambushed from.
      </p>
      <p>
        “But it would add another two nights, maybe three,” Aubre complained. “I
        don’t think Shahzade would much thank us for it.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “You let me deal with the boy,” he said, as they climbed into the
        drivers seat. With the door to the hurcha barred shut, her father
        maneuvered the yaks in a careful semicircle, the animals barely kept in
        check by the tie-downs. When they were facing away from the forest, and
        toward the outlet of the Gokyo Ri, he released the slack in the reins,
        and no later, the cart began crackling over the frozen surface of the
        river, Cho Oyo.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even as the yaks threw their weight into the harnesses, it was difficult
        to get moving across the slippery ice, but once they did, the animals
        thundered along with a deafening echo. The walls of the canyon slipping
        by in a watercolor of gray-brown stone, streaked bright blue with veins
        of ice.
      </p>
      <p>
        A dollop of snow fell from high up in the canyon, making a ledge of
        nesting grouse burst into the sky. Aubre startled, clutching the carved
        wooden railing. Everything seemed suddenly so hostile, dark clouds
        racing across the sky like something alive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Small bells on the yaks harnesses jingled with each hoofstep, but there
        was no cheer to the sound. It fell like a clangor on Aubre’s ears, far
        too loud in the failing light.
      </p>
      <p>
        Aubre’s hair whipped at her face and as they thundered along the frozen
        river. When at last they reached the edge of the canyon, it offered a
        sprawling view, the jagged peaks of the Tian Ma overtaken by hardy
        scrub-grass and the occasional dark green burst of tall prickly sage.
        Aubre blinked as fresh gusts of wind tore at the corners of her eyes,
        turning her cheeks bright pink.
      </p>
      <p>
        Known as Natansi, the vast desert was like an ocean separating the
        mountains from the distant modernity of the Royal City. Sand blowing off
        enormous sand dunes could have easily been mistaken for large, golden
        waves — making its other nickname, the Natans Sea — suddenly very
        prescient to Aubre, who had never ranged this far into the forest
        before.
      </p>
      <p>
        “But how do we get down?” she said, trying to pick out a path.
        Fortunately, this low into the valley, not everything was covered in
        snow, but the ice was still dangerous, and the yaks were not as
        sure-footed as horses. A single misstep could be lethal.
      </p>
      <p>
        "What?" said her father, unable to hear her over the rising gale.
        Abruptly, he looked up at the nearly-dark sky, thick with clouds. "If it
        snows, we’ll be stuck in the open.“
      </p>
      <p>
        There was a pause in the wind, which Aubre used as an opportunity to
        shout. “I think I see a way!” But just then, she heard the wooden wagon
        door open behind them, and turned her head to see the crown prince
        poking his head out.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Why have we stopped?” he called in his accented southron voice. “Are we
        there?”
      </p>
      <p>Aubre wanted to shout back, “Are you thick?” </p>
      <p>
        It would take them at least three days to reach Ledak, which he would
        well know, if he hadn’t had everything in his entire life scheduled,
        managed, and done for him. She was glad when her father spoke up before
        she could.
      </p>
      <p>“Nothing to worry over, merely giving the yaks a break,” he said.</p>
      <p>
        “Well, then let me get a break from this miserable cart as well. I feel
        like a sack of potatoes being hauled across the Milk Road.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Wouldn’t advise it, Shahzade,” shouted her father in sudden earnest. He
        wanted to get going, not follow the prince off gallivanting. “Real steep
        is all,” he said more gently, when the prince arched an eyebrow. “Best
        wait in the hurcha.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “I don’t know how it usually goes out here, Mister Fauchard,” he said,
        forcing open th small wooden door, which had already become encrusted in
        ice. He and his guards were tall and fair, in stark contrast to the
        people living this far north. With a head of red-blonde hair, and a fine
        headdress made of dark-blue silk, he looked every bit the crown prince.
        “But where I come from, the name Hari Hahn commands respect. If the
        bloody cows can stand around out here, then so can I.”
      </p>
      <p>
        No sooner than he’d stepped out, the wind picked up with such a force
        that his headdress was almost torn from his head, and the bands of
        dark-blue fabric that draped over his neck flapped into his eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Gah!” he startled, batting at his face as his guards emerged from the
        cart, looking concerned. Aubre tried to ignore the cacophony going on
        behind them as she mentally mapped the route down. Once they descended,
        it would be impossible to get the same view again, and one wrong turn
        with the hurcha as heavily loaded as it was could spell disaster.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>There was a flash of silver and a crack like thunder. </p>
      <p>“What was that?” said the prince.</p>
      <p>
        Aubre turned to silence him, unable to ignore his antics any longer,
        when from the rim of the canyon she saw what she first thought was
        falling snow, but then she blinked, and saw it to be see tens of
        wildcats descending the steep walls of the Gokyo Ri with long ice-blue
        spears clutched in their handpaws.
      </p>
      <p>
        Aubre screamed, pointing at the mountain. At this, all conversation
        ceased and everyone turned to look first at Aubre, and then at where she
        was pointing. Like the animal in the back of the hurcha, the creatures
        moved like mankind, but they all had the same catlike features,
        including heavy fur coats and long tails curling out behind them for
        balance. Aubre was petrified, unable to even think as the creatures ran
        at them with the intensity of an avalanche; a singular force of
        white-fur, as unstoppable as the real thing.
      </p>

    </div>
    <div className={style.copy}>
      <p>“Get down!”</p>
      <p>
        No sooner than Aubre heard her father shout, he jumped on top of her and
        a spear the length of Aubry’s entire torso thudded through one of the
        princes guards before shattering like ice against the canyon. Aubre
        screamed again before her father grabbed her by the soulders and shoved
        her toward the drivers seat, jumping in after her and cracking the reins
        over the yaks shoulders like a madman.
      </p>
      <p>
        When Aubre looked over her shoulder, she saw so much blood pouring over
        the snow, it was like a bottle of wine had broken. The prince had barely
        closed the door of the hurcha when they were overtaken by white fur and
        claws. In less time than it took to blink, a pair of huge white handpaws
        wrapped around the prince’s torso and ripped him from the small wagon
        window.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Shahzade!” Aubre screamed, but her father pulled her close so she
        couldn’t see. Driven by instinctive terror, the yaks made a mad dash
        down the slope, crashing through the undergrowth as the cart slid at
        crazy angles. It took Aubre a moment to realize that her father was
        speaking, not to her, but to himself. A prayer, eyes closed as the yaks
        drove themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a stab of panic, Aubre took the reins, doing her best to keep
        control of the cart. Behind them, more wildcats emerged, leaping down
        the mountainside with impossible speed. Two especially fast,
        silver-white animals had outpaced the rest and were quickly closing the
        distance between the cart as tears began to whip at Aubre’s eyes. She
        used one hand to give her father a good shake.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div className={style.comicPanel}>
      <img src="https://incurable.s3.amazonaws.com/2-animalkind-1.jpg" />
    </div>
    <div className={style.copy}>
      <p>
        “Papa!” she screamed. “You have to do something, there’s too many of
        them!”
      </p>
      <p>
        As if she’d broken some kind of trance, Astly Fauchard leapt into
        action, his military days coming back at once. He reached for the
        Alsaint-made rifle that he’d stowed under the wooden seat and thumbed
        through his pockets for ammunition. The muscles in Aubre’s arms felt
        like they were going to tear apart from steering the yaks, when the
        wagon shuddered as if they’d been hit by a canon.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the corner of Aubre’s eye, she could see an outline of white fur
        and knew that one of the wildcats had jumped onto the cart. But instead
        of attacking them, the animal seemed distracted by the carcasses. Aubre
        wondered if they were just after food when she heard something that
        didn’t sound like a snarl, or a growl, but a voice.
      </p>
      <p>“Lanoire?” it said.</p>

    </div>
    <div className={style.copy}>
      <p>
        Her father saw his opportunity and leapt up from the drivers seat facing
        the back of the cart. The animal lingered, its bright blue eyes wrought
        with confusion, and something else that Aubre didn’t have the time to
        identify — for the moment it looked up, her father racked his rifle and
        there was a deafening bang.
      </p>
      <p>A spray of red, like shaken wine, and the beast was gone.</p>
