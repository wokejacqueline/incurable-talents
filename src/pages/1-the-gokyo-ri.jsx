    <p>
      A group of snow white leonen jogged through the village clutching
      elaborate spears in their handpaws, while higher up along the ridge a
      small gray figure in a hooded cloak stopped to watch. Her fur was still
      dark and dappled with a juveniles spots, but she imagined herself among
      the tribe’s hunters all the same, appearing and disappearing through the
      swirling mists of the Black Forest.

    <p>“Lanoire!”</p>
    <p>
      Behind her, a string of woolly yaks shifted from hoof to hoof while she
      deliberated. They’d spent three nights in the Black Forest without as much
      as a glimpse of the Markhorein herds they were after. She was beginning to
      think they wouldn’t find them at all, until she’d seen a few females lying
      on rocky outcropping not far from camp this morning - but that was hours
      ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that they'd hiked halfway around the mountain to get a better shot at
      the animals, they were gone, and the ledge was empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      She heard boots crunching through the snow and a moment later there was a
      steadying hand on her shoulder. Aubre looked up to see her fathers dark
      eyes fixated on a frozen waterfall cascading down from overhead, the icy
      spikes of water cutting through the mist like daggers.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>“Dedre”</i> he cursed. “The beasts could’ve gone up, down, or sideways
      for all we know.”
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice was muffled by the bandana he wore over his nose and mouth, but
      Aubre could still hear the urgency. The trees in the surrounding woods
      began to tremble as another storm passed overhead, bigger than the last,
      and moving across the sky as if it were something alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father stooped in the snow to hunt for clues, turning up a few clumps
      of shed hair while Aubre scanned the cliffs. This high in the mountains,
      it seemed impossible to sustain creatures as large as Markhorein, let
      alone provide enough cover for them to disappear. The walls of the Gokyo
      Ri were made of slick gray stone with almost no vegetation that wasn't
      buried by five feet of packed snow. Yet the animals had vanished, the
      gentle snowfall erasing any trace they'd ever been there at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before long, a stream of voices piped up behind them. <i>Too loud</i>,
      thought Aubre. Now that they were out of the dense-growing wood of the
      forest, the noise carried through the canyon, echoing back at them from
      the ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Your sure this is the right place, Astly?” said a man as he picked his
      way toward Aubre's father, giving wide berth to the yaks standing in the
      middle of the trail. Like the other two men her father was guiding, he was
      dressed in a deep blue coat and black boots, and looked frozen near to the
      bone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing could possibly live here," continued the man, a puff of ice
      disappearing on the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Standing, her father shot him a look. Astly Fauchard was an older man,
      past sixty, but years of guiding hunters through the forest had kept him
      lean and alert as a greyhound. The elements were hostile and the hunting
      season slim, but according to him, guiding tourists through the Black
      Forest beat his days serving in the Land Army by a long shot. Still, the
      demanding hiking required to bag a Markhorein stag could bring out the
      worst in folks, and he was no stranger to the lordlings from down south
      trying to hurry things along.
    </p>
    <p>"Been doing this since before you were born," he said flatly.</p>
    <p>
      "I'm just saying. It's been days and we've seen nothing," the man
      complained. "My knees are going to give way before we find the wretched
      creatures."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I promised your lord son a shot, and he'll get that," said Astly, turning
      slowly on his heel, as if the Markhorein would suddenly materialize out of
      the rocks.
    </p>
    <p>The man blinked. "He's not my son, he's-"</p>
    <p>
      "Don't really think I need the details of the family tree, eh?" he said
      pointedly, in a tone that made the man fall quiet. "Now, keep down or
      you'll scare off the game."
    </p>
    <p>
      The man didn't seem satisfied with this answer, but they had little
      choice. Miles from Ledak, it was up to the Fauchard's to guide them safely
      through the wilderness. There were no trails and no signs of life except
      for the few clues Aubre and her father scry out of the snow, and those
      were disappearing by the second.
    </p>
    <p>“I don’t like it,” said Aubre in a voice only her father could hear.</p>
    <p>
      He shot her an imploring glance. "Not you, too? We'll find the beasts,
      they're close by. I can feel it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Aubry turned her attention back to the cliffs. She was only fifteen, but
      she had been accompanying her father through these woods since she was
      much younger. This was not the first time she’d helped guide a hunting
      party. Her keen eyes were able to easily pick out even the best
      camoflauged goats from the upper ranges of the Tian Ma, but it was the
      farthest they’d ever ranged into the forest before.

      The Black Forest was so vast that it encompassed entire mountain ranges,
      with thousands of undiscovered valleys and canyons tracing their way
      beneath the canopy. In most places it was considered impassable without a
      guide, the combination of sheer terrain, hostile climate, and the
      seemingly endless varieties of wildlife keeping her father occupied well
      through his retirement from the army.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, if they went up, they're unfollowable," she said. "Nothing can
      follow Markhorein in the mountains. We'll have to wait until morning."
    </p>
    <p>"Might not have gone up," her father replied.</p>
    <p>
      Aubre's mouth drew into a thin line, but she didn’t argue. The herds of
      Markhorein that roamed the Tian Ma attracted similar clientelle every
      spring, their coiled antlers and lion-like manes and tails appearing only
      in glimpses as the scaled slot canyons to graze in the grassy meadows that
      bloomed in the springtime, fed by melting snow. The upperclass traveled as
      far as the Royal City for the opportunity to bring down one of the beasts
      themselves, and they'd pay almost any price.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was for this reason that their own survival through Ledak's blistering
      winters depended on guiding hunters like these on the most well-traveled
      game paths of the forest. If the Markhorein had gone into the valley below
      from here, there was a good chance they'd come back up the same way. She'd
      seen the animals before, and could easily guess their habits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Markhorein had no natural predators that could hunt them from above, which
      was why they'd circled around the mountain in the first place. Now that
      they were angled above the creatures path, it was just a matter of waiting
      until they returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The youngest of the trio approached them, with both arms wrapped around
      himself in the cold. Despite being scrawny and pink-cheeked, he had a
      heavy-looking rifle strapped around one shoulder, finer than any weapon
      Aubre had ever seen before. Wisps of red hair were visible under the hood
      of his cloak, which was trimmed in blond wolf fur and decorated in silver
      buttons, lending him an air of regality that his face alone did not
      posess.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>"Shahzade,"</i> said both of the men accompanying him, giving a small
      bow.
    </p>
    <p>"What's going on?" he sniffed, pulling his scarf up over his nose.</p>
    <p>
      He'd been traveling in the back of a small wooden <i>hurcha</i> and barely
      even had snow on his boots. Yolked to one of the yaks, the cart provided a
      much easier ride than the hike the rest of them had endured, but it was
      small and leaden down with supplies, and could barely fit another bag of
      oats. "Why have we stopped?"
    </p>
    <p>"We've lost the trail," said Aubre.</p>
    <p>
      "Hm", said the boy, hands resting on his hips as he stared around the
      incoming waves of snow. "I'm for anything that involves a fire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doesn't seem like we have much choice," said Aubre. Making any progress
      on the trail, up or down, could easily prove lethal in this weather.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kids are right," said her father. "Wont be able to see a thing when it
      starts coming down, anyway. Best wait til morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      Although there was still hours until nightfall, the men made camp in the
      lee of the canyon while Aubre tended to the yaks. She'd dug a hole in the
      snow and cut open a bag of mixed barley and oats, which the woolly animals
      quickly set to nuzzling out of the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she'd removed the yaks harnesses and stowed the hurcha behind a hill
      of rocks, she rejoined the others just as a small fire was born, and knelt
      to warm her hands. Pulling off her gloves, Aubry bent her fingers in the
      firelight, the cold making her joints as stiff as someone four times her
      age.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had little more than rolled wolf and buffalo hides to shield them
      from the elements, but the fire grew as her father shaved down a few large
      logs with an axe, exposing the dry inner wood within. The flames cast
      everyone under a spell, and soon they were all staring wordlessly into the
      fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the younger boy who uncorked a slender bottle of cloudy pink
      <i>kalakatta,</i> breaking the reverie. Aubre's father looked over at him,
      restraining a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>"Bit young to have such a habit, aren't you son?"</p>
    <p>
      The boy smiled. He had fine, girlish features and a chin that tapered into
      an impish point.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Picked it up in town," he said, although with the tilt of his smile, it
      was hard to know if he could be believed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aubre found them all a little strange. She'd never viewed the trips into
      the Black Forest as anything more than a job, the many faces she'd met
      easily forgotten and replaced by the next. This far away from the southern
      cities, she couldn't afford to be interested in anything other than
      surviving each winter. People came and went, that would always be true.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following morning when the snow cleared, they woke to a clear view of
      the largest herd of Markhorein Aubre had ever seen, grazing on the
      opposite cliffs. Aubre had barely risen from under a roll of wolf fur when
      she saw them, two stags with coiled antlers grazing in the warmth of the
      sun, a dozen females and calves dotting the cliffs nearby.
