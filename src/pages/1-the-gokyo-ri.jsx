      <h1>1. The Gokyo Ri</h1>
      <h2>Lanoire</h2>
      <p>
        A group of snow white Leonen jogged through the village clutching
        elaborate spears in their handpaws, while high on the ridge a small gray
        figure in hooded robes stopped to watch.
      </p>

      <p>
        Her fur was still dark and dappled with a juveniles spots, but she
        imagined herself among the tribe’s hunters all the same, appearing and
        disappearing through the swirling mists of the Black Forest like the
        Panthera of old.
      </p>

      <p>“Lanoire!”</p>
      <p>She'd lingered too long.</p>
      <p>
        Her mother turned back down the steps leading to Temple of Bast to pinch
        her ear. “No one has been late in generations, and no daughter of mine
        will be the first. Come.”
      </p>
      <p>"Is it the herds?” she asked.</p>
      <p>
        A shadow crossed over her mothers face. "The river Oyo is still locked
        in ice, it will be weeks before they descend. You should know this."
      </p>
      <p>
        Lanoire <i>should</i> have known this - but why else would the tribe's
        warriors be going into the Black Forest?
      </p>
      <p>
        According to her mother, spring was still more than a month away - a
        sense she had after studying the Panthera all her life, and one Lanoire
        was supposed to have developed by now, too. But even after all her
        mornings studying in the temple, it seemed to her that spring was just
        around the corner. The snow was turning to slush in places, and Lanoire
        couldn't help picturing the lower valley flooded with wildlife,
        signaling the start of the Tian Ma's short hunting season.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lanoire risked another glance at the disappearing spear tips, searching
        for her father. Under the shifting wolf pelts and markhorein skull-masks
        she couldn't find his face, but she knew he was among them.
      </p>
    </div>

      <p>
        “Lanoire, if I have to tell you again-” her mothers voice interrupted,
        and she was forced to look away.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I’m going as fast as I can,” she bit back, her tufted ears flattening
        against her long black hair as she jogged to catch up.
      </p>
      <p>
        She’d tripped on her robes more than once already and the bracelets she
        wore around her wrists and ankles did not make things any easier. The
        trek to the Temple of Bast threaded up a narrow trail etched into the
        mountainside, one she’d walked many times before, but which now felt
        impossibly distant dressed in heavy robes.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Perhaps if I wasn’t wearing this old blanket,” Lanoire began, but was
        quickly cut short.
      </p>
      <p>
        "If you’d gotten up on time, you could’ve dressed in the temple,” came
        her mother’s low growl.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lanoire made a face, and they walked the rest of the way in silence, not
        reaching the end of the trail until the sun was at their backs and the
        village below them lost to an ocean of pink and white clouds. To those
        on the ground, the temple was little more than speck, visible only in
        glimpses through the parting clouds — but up close, Lanoire could see
        the sparkling blue glacier, cut into bricks and formed into a
        spectacular palace of ice.
      </p>
    </div>
    {/* The image component thingy */}

    </div>
    <div className={style.copy}>
      <p>
        Carved with huge statues of Panthera, the ice gleamed in the morning
        sunlight. Lanoire walked with her eyes downcast, eager to be past them.
        Even after all these years, she'd never been able to shake the old fear
        that she was being watched.
      </p>

      <p>
        Her mother had once told her that the Panthera of old were watching over
        them all, but Lanoire had never come to appreciate the distinction. From
        a young age, the statues in the temple loomed in the back of her mind,
        the towering faces of Bast’s daughters even following her in dreams.
      </p>

      <p>
        She was glad when at last they entered the gloom of the temple itself,
        its deep-blue walls rising around them like an ocean wave. Lanoire
        hesitated as her mother rapped her staff on a crack in the ground and
        blue flames sprang up from beneath it, racing toward the edges of the
        temple.
      </p>
      <p>
        Producing no heat, the blaze bathed everything in a shade of pale
        underwater blue. She’d seen her mother do this many times, but couldn’t
        help the shiver that ran through her each time cold air rushed through
        the glacier. When she was much younger she’d been incessantly curious
        about the staff, but as she got older, she realized it merely created a
        spark, which ignited the fire-beds at the edge of the temple.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mechanism only <i>seemed</i> magical.
      </p>

    <div className={style.copy}>
      <p>
        In a rectangular pool of water at the temples heart, Lanoire could see
        her reflection, and frowned at how formal she looked. The sare she wore
        had belonged to her mother when she was her age, but it was still far
        too big on her, and draped off her shoulders like a curtain, making her
        look even smaller than she was.
      </p>
      <p>
        She'd been told she'd grow into it, but it was taking an awfully long
        time. Spring had crossed the mountains twelve times already, but the
        watercolor of black spots she'd been born with still covered her
        stubbornly from ear to tailtip. Her brothers, who were only a few
        minutes older than she was, had grown into their adult fur two years
        ago, yet she still had the countenance of a dark mountain sheep.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the thirteenth spring of Lanoire's life right around the corner,
        she studied her reflection at any opportunity, eager to see the same
        change in herself.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div className={style.copy}>
      <p>“Set the tea,” came her mothers low command.</p>
      <p>“I know,” she huffed.</p>
      <p>
        The routine never changed. In fact, it seemed somehow inescapable. Each
        morning, she endured a grueling hike to the temple to read from old
        books and stone tablets that she barely understood, only to hike back
        down at dusk to help with chores until she was exhausted. All while her
        brothers sharpened their claws hunting in the Black Forest.
      </p>
      <p>It wasn't fair.</p>
      <p>
        {" "}
        She'd long suspected that her mind was just not cut out for such
        learning. She craved the thrill of the wind in her fur, the sound of
        prey creeping through the darkness of the woods. Even now, she could not
        focus on her chores or the serenity of the dripping glacier. Her mind
        wandered, searching for a distraction.
      </p>

      <p>
        She dragged the samovar across the ice with a clatter, earning her a
        glare from her mother, but Lanoire ignored it. Her mother was dressed in
        a matching silver robe, called a <i>Sare</i>, but her fur had long ago
        turned the same off-white as the rest of their clade, with only the
        faintest gray ringlets of spots still visible on her forehead.
      </p>
      <p>
        On her the sare seemed regal — fitting for the tribes matron. At nearly
        sixty years old, and with three surviving children, her mother was a
        rarity among their clade. The punishing winters of the Tian Ma made it
        nearly impossible to raise young, but in spite of that, the entire
        litter survived, growing older and stronger each year.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lanoire and her two brothers were born during a lucky burst of warm
        weather, and they’d been well-looked after by the tribe ever since. Even
        now, the memory of three infant leonen hiding under their mothers robes
        seemed to tug at the villagers collective heartstrings. It had been so
        long since there were children in the village, their every antic was
        seen as endearing.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div className={style.copy}>
      <p>
        Nowadays, they were constantly supervised — or as Nasir liked to joke,
        <i> guarded</i>. Although the Tian Ma were a vast range of mountains,
        they'd been warned since birth to stick to the safety of the upper peaks
        of Nehenya and the Goy Oyo. The forests below were Dogan territory and
        viciously guarded, but her brothers had snuck off more than once,
        regailing her with tales of dense greenery and mists as thick as snow.
      </p>
      <p>
        A loud crack somewhere deep in the glacier made Lanoire startle,
        sloshing the tea over the rim of the cup. She was suddenly glad for her
        dark fur - at least the dark blue liquid did not leave a stain. When the
        noise came again the glacier cracked and rattled, like it was going to
        split in two straight on top of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        A moment later, a young male leonen appeared at the entrance. His
        footpaws had been so loud and clumsy, it sounded like an avalanche.
        Breathless from racing up the trail on his own, he struggled to find his
        words while he leaned on the temple's columns.
      </p>
      <p>“Alena,” he breathed.</p>
    </div>
    {/* The image component thingy */}
    <div className={style.comicPanel}>
      <img src="https://incurable.s3.amazonaws.com/1-gokyo-ri-3.jpg" />
    </div>
    <div className={style.copy}>
      <p>
        The name traveled like a gust of wind through the still air. Her mother
        was momentarily stunned, unable to register the sight of another
        creature standing there, until she composed herself enough to stalk
        toward him, radiating barely-contained fury.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Did you follow us?” she hissed, suddenly seeming much younger than her
        years. A pair of curved white teeth were exposed when she growled. “None
        are allowed in the Temple of Bast but the daughters of-”
      </p>
      <p>“Forgive me, please, Alena,” he cut in. </p>
      <p>
        Lanoire recognized him as one of the tribes warriors, a red Dogan
        longbow strapped to his shoulders and a wolf’s pelt covering most of his
        torso. He saw Lanoire standing there with the tea and hastily covered
        his eyes, as if he'd caught her undressing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lanoire didn't know what to make of it. Nobody had ever interrupted her
        lessons before.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Part seven and eight, the <i>Firstborns</i> and <i>Polynasium</i>,"
        said her mother as she reached the heavy columns of ice that lined the
        temples entrance. "I’ll just be a moment dealing with this fool."
      </p>
      <p>
        Lanoire’s ears strained to catch the conversation outside as she reached
        for a set of heavy stone tablets. Chiseled with many years of clawmarks,
        her family had added to the writings of Panthera every generation, and
        one day, it would be Lanoire's job to do the same. Each morning since
        she was strong enough to climb the six thousand steps to the peak of
        Nehenya, she’d followed in the pawsteps of her mother, and her mothers’
        mother to study, memorizing Starmaps and reciting Panteran grammar until
        she could hardly think.
      </p>
      <p>
        A flutter of excitement made Lanoire’s stomach turn at this sudden
        change of events. What could possibly be so important as to follow them
        all the way up here? Lanoire was surprised he’d made the trek at all, as
        the sheer ice was punishing, even for their own clade. Lanoire could
        only do it because she’d always done it, the routine turning her thighs
        to hard, steely sinew.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Slow down, breathe,” her mother was saying. “Tell me what you saw. How
        far into the Gokyo Ri were they?”
      </p>
      <p>
        They momentarily switched to <i>Pantaren</i>, the language of
        Animalkind, which Lanoire only knew a little of. Filled with snarls and
        growls, it sounded more like a fight than a conversation. Lanoire still
        couldn’t understand very much of it, but the mention of the Gokyo Ri
        made her prick her ears.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not a moment later, her mother reentered the temple looking flustered.
        Lanoire tried to look like she'd been reading, but she couldn't stop
        herself from peering curiously around the columns where the warrior
        still waited, breathing clouds of white vapor into the air. Noticing
        this, her mother moved to block her line of sight.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lanoire looked up at her quizzically. Surely, the day wasn’t going to
        continue as normal after such an interruption?
      </p>
      <p>
        “You'll be studying by yourself until I return,” she said seriously.
      </p>
      <p>“What?”</p>
      <p>
        Lanoire’s voice bounced back off the ice so loudly, the water in the
        pool vibrated. She lowered her ears, mollified by the echo. “But why?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Shh,” hissed her mother, her eyes cutting toward the ceiling. The
        morning light made thin yellow beams in the air, where a single droplet
        of snowmelt could be seen spiraling off an icicle and into the pool
        below, causing rings to radiate across the still water.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her mother frowned, looking at her imploringly. “Lanoire, a small change
        in routine does not excuse you from your responsibilities. Consider your
        studies before yourself, for a change.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Lanoire stared down the slate tablets as if they were opponents in a
        fight. At the door, her mother held her gaze, the blue of the temple
        refracting off her steely gray eyes.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div className={style.copy}>
      <p>
        “I'll be back soon enough, and'll be expecting a summary with emphasis
        on the <i>many functions</i> of Polynasium when I return."
      </p>
      <p>
        Lanoire didn't even know what that word meant, but her mother
        disappeared before she could argue, and the temple quickly settled into
        it's all-encompassing silence. It was still early in the morning, and
        who knew when her mother would return? Lanoire sighed. There was little
        else to do but read.
      </p>
      <p>
        Studying the Panthera was almost as grueling as the walk to the temple.
        The tablets had been compiled by many generations of handpaws, the
        oldest stones so smooth that the inscriptions were barely legible. All
        clades of Animalkind had their own such texts; words of law, territory
        and culture.
      </p>
      <p>
        The clade of Canidae had their Dogan Ra, most Avian lived according to
        the commandments in their Stardex, but even though her parents had
        inscribed some of the more recent inserts of the Panthera themselves,
        the writing was archaic and difficult to understand. A whole hour passed
        and the words still swam in front of her eyes, the drawings of the
        clades blurring together.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Leonen, Tigren, Jaguarn, Caraclene.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        She knew some of the others, but not well. Canidae had their
        <i> Dogan, Cyrote</i>, and <i>Wolf</i>, while the Avian were made up of
        long-feathered <i>Strigine</i> and colorful <i>Sitisine</i>, and
        according to her parents, had once been made up of many others.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was a deep groan of ice from the glacier, followed by a resounding
        crack that made her jump. Except this time, instead of the usual quiet
        that resumed after the ice shifted, the sound was accompanied by
        whispers and clumsy footfalls. She stiffened in disbelief — two
        interruptions in one day? Was nothing sacred anymore? Her green eyes
        appeared bright blue as she searched the echoing chamber.
      </p>
      <p>“Noire,” said a voice.</p>
      <p>
        “Mother?” she said, but even as she said it, she knew the voices didn’t
        match. It was too high, too wavering.
      </p>
      <p>
        She turned to see two faces peering around the columns of the Temple of
        Bast. Her brothers, Sabin and Nasir, both looking around in amazement.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div className={style.comicPanel}>

    </div>
    <div className={style.copy}>
      <p>
        “What are you two doing here?” she growled, unable to hide her surprise.
        Puffs of ice evaporated on her breath.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sabin, who was younger than Nasir, but still older than Lanoire by
        several minutes was the first to speak.
      </p>
      <p>
        “It's the herds,” he blurted, his voice echoing through the temple like
        a gunshot. He was short and stout compared to her oldest brother, with a
        subtle tint of red to his fur that made his spots appear like rings left
        behind on a table from creamed tea. “They're descending the Gokyo Ri.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Lanoire pinned her ears at this news, crossing her arms. She looked to
        her eldest brother, who was usually the more trustworthy.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Now? But it isn’t late enough into the season," she responded. Even her
        mother had said the same, and Lanoire couldn't remember a time when
        she'd ever been wrong.
      </p>
      <p>Nasir only shrugged. “Suppose spring came early this year.”</p>
      <p>
        Lanoire searched his face for some crease of a lie. At this altitude,
        anything larger than rabbits were a rarity, and even those were hard to
        come by. The herds of Markhorein that lived in the mountains were
        elusive and kept to the highest, steepest cliffs of the Gokyo Ri, where
        they could easily disappear.
      </p>
      <p>
        A flash of speartips swam through her memory, Leonen jogging
        side-by-side through the snow. So she'd been right about the herds. The
        prospect of such a spectacular hunt made Lanoire’s heart thrill, but
        skepticism still gripped her.
      </p>
      <p>It was too good to be true.</p>
      <p>
        “I saw them,” Nasir continued. “Two of the biggest bulls I've ever seen,
        and a whole bunch of those golden kids. So little, I bet even you could
        catch one, Noire.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Lanoire pinned her ears at the jibe, but looked between her brothers all
        the same. She was supposed to be studying, but even if she wanted to,
        how could she stay indoors now? The mountains called to her like wind to
        a bird. She barely cast a look over the cool blue walls of the temple
        before slipping out of her robes and casting aside as many of the
        traditional crystals she wore as she could before running for the
        slender beams of daylight at the temples entrance, the slates of the
        discarded Panthera still scattered across the ice.

      <p>
        Against a near-obliterating backdrop of powdery white snow, it was easy
        to miss the outlines of three young leonen slinking along the ridgeline.

        Between the gray-brown streaks of rock and the spindly white birch and
        aspen trees that still clung on at this altitude, they were practically
        invisible. The air was thin as a razor blade, but Lanoire was glad to be
        running. Like her brothers, she relished in her own natural strength,
        and leapt down narrow crevasses in the mountain without as much as a
        second glance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although her brothers were only a few minutes older than she was, they
        were much larger. Their dark gray baby fur replaced by the same glossy
        off-white coat shared by rest of her clade two springs ago. Against the
        snow they were invisible, while Lanoire was forced to hesitate at each
        clearing.

        Unlike them, she was easy to spot out in the open, and could easily
        spook the herd if she moved too quickly. She dashed from boulder to
        boulder, crouching low against the rough rock face as sweeping gusts of
        wind threatened to toss her right over the edge.

        “Shouldn’t we go down?” she said in a voice barely above a whisper. She
        was never allowed this far from the village, and could feel her handpaws
        trembling in the wind. “If the Markhorein have gone into the valley, we
        wont run into them from way up here.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Nasir merely scented the air, flattening himself low against the snow as
        he picked up something on the breeze.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Don't need to run into them,” he said, his voice tremulous with
        excitement. “They need to run into us. If we stay above them, we have
        the element of surprise.”
      </p>
      <p>"What do you mean?” said Lanoire.</p>
      <p>
        "The herd wont stay late in the valley, they’ll come back up
        eventually,” he said quietly. “And when they do, we'll be ready.”
      </p>
      <p>
        They edged along the rim, carefully picking out a path down the
        near-vertical grade of the canyon. If they could catch sight of the herd
        down below, it would merely be a matter of finding a good spot to hide.
      </p>
      <p>
        But with little vegetation able to conceal them as they struck out
        further on the cliffs, Lanoire felt every hair on the back of her neck
        standing up. In some places, there was nothing but snow, and what little
        cover she could find was hunched into narrow gaps in the rock.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suddenly, Nasir stopped, ducking low on a ledge only a little bigger
        than he was. Lanoire and Sabin followed suit as he pointed to a shady
        crease in the mountains where a herd of some ten Markhorein stood
        pulling thick yellow reeds from the still knee-deep snow. They were
        guarded by a large male with a rack of spiraling black antlers and a tan
        mane, flit with gray, running down his throat.
      </p>
      <p>Nasir licked his lips. “Look at the size of that bull.”</p>

      <p>
        Lanoire frowned. The male was larger than the wild horses that roamed
        the edges of the Black Forest, with a huge rack of spiraling antlers as
        large as the animal itself. She put a handpaw on her brothers shoulder.
      </p>
      <p>“How will we get him out of here with just the three of us?” </p>
      <p>“Which one, then?” </p>
      <p>
        Lanoire scanned the herd thoughtfully. There were two females with young
        kids by their side and a gang of scrawny yearlings hemming around in the
        shadows. Lanoire pointed at one of the older females, a hash of silver
        scars already emblazoned on her shoulder.
      </p>
      <p>“That one.”</p>
      <p>
        Nasir considered her choice, then said, "Fine," and they struck out
        again, moving with agonizing slowness as they watched the herd graze in
        the distance. They were completely unaware of the approaching danger.
        One of them looked up abruptly, making them all freeze, but its head
        swiveled around in the opposite direction, its round ears twitching at a
        sound carrying on the wind.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just as they got close enough to the ledge to make out the herd in
        detail, a loud bang ricocheted off the Gokyo Ri and the snow under
        Lanoire’s footpaws give way. Before she could do anything to stop it,
        she went careening over the cliff in a spray of snow. She thought she
        saw something glinting on the other side of the canyon, but then her
        head hit a rock and she went crashing into the ravine, her brothers
        startled faces the last thing she remembered as the world disappeared
        behind her.
