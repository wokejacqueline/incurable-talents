    <h1>1. The Gokyo Ri</h1>
    <h2>Lanoire</h2>
    <p>
      A group of snow white leonen jogged through the village clutching
      elaborate spears in their handpaws, while higher up along the ridge a
      small gray figure in a hooded cloak stopped to watch.
    </p>

    <p>
      Her fur was still dark and dappled with a juveniles spots, but she
      imagined herself among the tribe’s hunters all the same, appearing and
      disappearing through the swirling mists of the Black Forest, like the
      Panthera of old.
    </p>

    <p>“Lanoire!”</p>
    <p>She'd lingered too long.</p>
    <p>
      Her mother turned back down the steps leading to Temple of Bast to pinch
      her ear. “No one has been late to the temple in generations, and no
      daughter of mine will be the first. Come.”
    </p>
    <p>“Are they still looking for Nasir and Sabin?” she asked.</p>
    <p>
      Her mother merely scowled, declining to answer - but Lanoire knew that
      they were. She risked another glance at the disappearing spear tips,
      searching for her father. Under the shifting wolf pelts and markhorein
      skull-masks she couldn't find his face, but she knew he was among them.
    </p>

    <p>Her brothers were going to be in so much trouble.</p>
    <p>
      Half of the tribes warriors were looking for them, more than had ever gone
      before. This wasn’t the first time they’d gone off on one of their
      escapades - they had something of a knack for it - but never before had
      they disappeared so close to the spring melt. In only a few weeks time,
      the river Oyo would break free of the ice, and the valleys below would be
      flooded with wildlife.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Lanoire, if I have to tell you again-” her mothers voice interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I’m going as fast as I can,” Lanoire bit back, her tufted ears flattening
      against her long black hair as she jogged to catch up.
    </p>
    <p>
      She’d tripped on her robes more than once already and the bracelets she
      wore around her wrists and ankles did not make things any easier. The trek
      to the Temple of Bast threaded up a narrow trail etched into the
      mountainside, one she’d walked many times before, but which now felt
      impossibly distant, dressed as she was in heavy ceremonial robes.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Maybe if I wasn’t wearing this old blanket,” Lanoire began, but was
      quickly cut short.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Maybe if you’d gotten up on time, you could’ve dressed in the temple,”
      came her mother’s low growl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lanoire made a face, and they walked the rest of the way in silence, not
      reaching the end of the trail until the sun was at their backs and the
      village below them lost to an ocean of pink and white clouds. To those on
      the ground, the temple was little more than speck, visible only in
      glimpses through the parting clouds — but up close, the ancient blue
      glacier had been cut into bricks and formed into a spectacular palace of
      ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Huge effigies of ancient Panthera carved from the ice gazed down at her as
      Lanoire bowed low at the temples entrance. Even when she stood, she walked
      with her eyes lowered, eager to be past them. She'd never been able to
      shake the old fear that she was being watched. Her mother had once told
      her that the Panthera of old were watching over them all, but Lanoire had
      never come to appreciate the distinction.
    </p>
    <p>
      From a young age, the statues in the temple loomed in the back of her
      mind, the towering faces of Bast’s daughters even following her in dreams.
    </p>

    </div>

    <p>
      She was glad to be past them when at last they entered the gloom of the
      temple itself, deep-blue walls rising around them like an ocean wave.
      Lanoire hesitated as her mother rapped her staff on a crack in the ground
      and blue flames sprang up from beneath it, racing around the edges of the
      temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      Producing no heat, the blaze bathed everything in a shade of pale
      underwater blue. She’d seen her mother do this many times, but couldn’t
      help the shiver that ran through her each time cold air rushed through the
      glacier. When she was much younger she’d been incessantly curious about
      the staff, but as she got older, she realized it merely created a spark
      which ignited the fire-beds at the edge of the temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mechanism only <i>seemed</i> magical.
    </p>

    <p>
      In a rectangular pool of water at the temples heart, Lanoire could see her
      reflection, and frowned at how formal she looked. The sare she wore had
      belonged to her mother when she was her age, but it was still far too big
      on her, and draped off her shoulders like a curtain.
    </p>
    <p>
      She'd been told she'd grow into it, but it was taking an awfully long
      time. Spring had come and gone twelve times, but the watercolor of black
      spots she'd been born with still covered her stubbornly from ear to tail.
      Her brothers, who were only a few minutes older than she was, had grown
      into their adult fur two years ago. With the thirteenth spring of
      Lanoire's life right around the corner, she'd began studying her
      reflection at any opportunity, eager to see the same change in herself.
    </p>

    <p>“Set the tea,” came her mothers low command.</p>
    <p>“I know,” she huffed. </p>
    <p>The routine never changed. </p>
    <p>
      The thrum of duty and work that’d been drilled into her since birth seemed
      somehow inescapable. Each morning, she endured a grueling hike to practice
      for a ceremony which came only once per year, and would have once been
      attended by thousands of Animalkind, but now was only the tribe, and a few
      brave traveling Stryga, huddled together in the cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Kaiz om kaiza</i>, the adults said to one another in Panteran as spring
      drew nearer. It was a saying all Animalkind knew. Meant as a well-wish
      among their clade, the words were on everyones lips as the days
      lengthened, even the Stryga. An old saying, <i>Hunt or or be hunted.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      She dragged the samovar across the ice-tiles with a clatter, earning her
      aglare from her mother, but Lanoire ignored this. Her mother was dressed
      in a matching silver sare, but her fur had long ago turned silvery-white,
      with only the faintest gray ringlets of spots still visible on her
      forehead. On her the sare seemed regal — fitting for the tribes matron.
    </p>
    <p>
      At nearly sixty years old, and with three surviving children, her mother
      was a rarity among their clade. The harsh winters of Nehenya made it
      nearly impossible to raise young, but in spite of that, the entire litter
      survived, growing older and stronger year after year.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lanoire and her two brothers were born during a lucky burst of warm
      weather, and they’d been well-looked after by the entire tribe ever since.
      Even now, the memory of three infant leonen hiding under their mothers
      robes seemed to tug at the villagers collective heartstrings. It had been
      so long since there were children in the village, every antic was seen as
      endearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nowadays, they were constantly supervised — or as Nasir liked to joke,
      guarded. Which is why everyone was so ruffled when the boys ran off. At
      least three adults had been watching them the entire time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brewed from the blooms of evergreen trees and mixed with spoonfuls of
      minerals, the tea tasted like perfumed dirt. She made sure to pour a
      little less in her cup before putting both on a tray - but just as she
      did, a figure appeared at the door. A young male leonen, breathless from
      racing up the trail on his own.
    </p>

    <p>“Alena,” he breathed.</p>
    <p>
      The name traveled like a gust of wind through the still air of the temple.
      Her mother was momentarily stunned, until she composed herself enough to
      stalk toward him, radiating waves of barely-contained fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Did you follow us?” she hissed, suddenly seeming much younger than her
      years. A pair of curved white teeth were exposed when she growled. “None
      are allowed in the Temple of Bast but the daughters of-”
    </p>
    <p>“Forgive me, please, Alena,” he cut in. </p>
    <p>
      Lanoire recognized him as one of the tribes warriors, a red Dogan longbow
      strapped to his shoulders and a wolf’s pelt covering most of his torso. He
      saw Lanoire standing there and hastily covered his eyes, as if he'd caught
      her undressing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lanoire didn't know what to make of it. Nobody had ever interrupted them
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Finish the tea. I’ll just be a moment dealing with this fool,” said her
      mother as she reached the heavy ice columns lining temples entrance, the
      young warrior backpedaling like a frightened child.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lanoire’s ears strained to catch the conversation outside as she wrapped
      one handpaw in the extra fabric of her sleeves pressed the cup to her
      lips, the chalky minerals in the tea staining her teeth and gums blue.
    </p>

    <p>
      Her family had maintained the Temple of Bast for generations, and every
      morning since Lanoire was strong enough to climb the six thousand steps to
      the peak, she’d followed in the footsteps of her mother, and her mothers’
      mother to study and learn the tribes traditions. While her brothers
      learned to stalk markhorein in the Gokyo Ri, Lanoire had to memorize
      Starmaps and recite grammar in Panteran.
    </p>
    <p>
      A flutter of excitement made Lanoire’s stomach turn at this sudden change
      of events. What could possibly be so important as to follow them all the
      way up here? Lanoire was surprised he’d made the trek at all, as the sheer
      ice was punishing, even for their own clade. Lanoire could only do it
      because she’d always done it, the routine turning her thighs to hard,
      steely sinew.
    </p>
    <p>Had they found Nasir and Sabin already?</p>
    <p>
      “Slow down, breathe,” her mother was saying. “Tell me what you saw. How
      far into the Gokyo Ri were they?”
    </p>
    <p>
      They momentarily switched to Pantaren, the language of animals, which
      Lanoire only knew a little of. Filled with snarls and low growls, it
      sounded more like a fight than a conversation. Lanoire still couldn’t
      understand very much of it, but the mention of the Gokyo Ri made her prick
      her ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a moment later, her mother reentered the temple looking flustered.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mama, what’s wrong?” said Lanoire, abandoning the tea at the sight of her
      mothers flustered face, but she threw out a handpaw to stop her, motioning
      for Lanoire to stay put.
    </p>
    <p>
      She froze. From a shelf made of ice, her mother fingered the spine of a
      heavy green-bound book, before carrying it in both arms across the temple,
      as if a sudden instinct that her daughter wasn’t studying had kicked in.
      She dropped the tome on the floor in front of Lanoire, the pages blowing
      open to a random place in the middle, where drawings of the clades of
      Panthera gleamed in colorful ink.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Leonen, Jaguarn, Tigren, Caraclene.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Lanoire looked up at her mother quizzically. Surely, the day wasn’t going
      to continue as normal after their earlier interruption? Lanoire peered
      around the ice columns, where the warrior still waited at the temples
      entrance, breathing clouds of white vapor into the air, but her mother
      moved to block her line of sight, and their eyes locked.
    </p>

    <p>
      “Chapter seventeen and eighteen,” she said seriously. “You'll be studying
      by yourself until I return.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What?” Lanoire’s voice bounced back at her off the ice so loudly, the
      water in the pool vibrated. She lowered her ears, mollified by the echo.
      “But why?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Shh,” said her mother, her eyes cutting toward the ceiling. Carved with
      interlocking hexagonal designs, the sunlight made small beams of yellow
      light streak through the glacier. A single droplet of snow melt spiraled
      off an icicle, causing rings to radiate across the surface of the pool of
      water below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mother frowned. “Lanoire, a small change in routine does not excuse
      you from your responsibilities. Consider your studies before yourself, for
      a change.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Annoyed, but unable to argue, Lanoire stared down the open book as if were
      an opponent in a fight. At the door, her mother held her gaze, the blue of
      the temple refracting off her steely gray eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I'll be back soon enough, and'll be expecting a summary on the first half
      of chapter seventeen when I return, with emphasis on the Firstborns and
      the many functions of Polynasium.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Lanoire didn't even know what those words meant, but after her mother
      disappeared, the temple once again settled into it's all-encompassing
      silence.{" "}

    <p>What else was there to do but read?</p>

        <strong>SCENE:</strong>Lanoire reading
      </span>
    </div>

    <p>
      Studying the Panthera was almost as grueling as the walk to the temple.
      The book had been compiled by many generations of handpaws, the oldest
      pages crumbling and tattered at the edges. All the clades of Animalkind
      had their own such book, a book of laws, territories and culture.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clade of Canidae had their Dogan Ra, most Birds lived lives according
      to the commandments set forth in their Stardexes, but even though her
      parents had penned some of the more recent inserts of the Panthera
      themselves, the writing was archaic and difficult to understand. A whole
      hour passed and the words still swam in front of her eyes, drawings of
      leonen and caraclene blurring together with territory lines until it was
      all a meaningless jumble.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lanoire had long suspected that her mind was just not cut out for such
      learning. She craved the thrill of the wind in her fur, the sound of prey
      creeping through the darkness of the woods. Even now, she could not focus
      on her breathing or the serenity of the dripping glacier like her mother
      would have told her to do. Her mind wandered, searching the furthest
      reaches of her hearing for a distraction; anything, to take her mind off
      the surrounding silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a deep groan of ice from the glacier, followed by a resounding
      crack that made her jump. Except this time, instead of the usual quiet
      that resumed after the ice shifted, the sound was accompanied by whispers
      and clumsy footfalls. She stiffened in disbelief — two interruptions in
      one day? Was nothing sacred anymore? Her green eyes appeared bright blue
      as she searched the echoing chamber.
    </p>
    <p>“Noire,” said a voice.</p>
    <p>
      “Mother?” she said, but the voice didn’t match. It was too high, too
      wavering.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned to see two much smaller faces peering around the carved ice
      doorway to the Temple of Bast. Her brothers, Sabin and Nasir, both holding
      fistfuls of beads from their robes, so the glass would not clack together
      and echo.
    </p>
    <div className={style.comicPanel}>

        <strong>SCENE:</strong>
        <b>NASIR</b> and <b>SABIN</b> lookin around the temple columns
      </span>
    </div>
    <p>
      “What are you two doing here?” she growled, unable to hide her surprise.
      Puffs of ice evaporated on her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sabin, who was younger than Nasir, but still older than Lanoire by several
      minutes was the first to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It's the herds,” he blurted, his voice echoing through the temple like a
      gunshot. He was short and stout compared to her oldest brother, with a
      subtle tint of red to his fur that made his spots appear like rings from
      creamed tea. “They're descending the Gokyo Ri.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Lanoire pinned her ears at this news, crossing her arms. She looked to her
      eldest brother, who was usually the more trustworthy.{" "}
    </p>
    <p>
      “It isn’t late enough into the season," she responded, "Didn’t you see the
      snow? They wont descend until the ice breaks.“
    </p>
    <p>Nasir only shrugged. “Suppose spring came early this year.”</p>
    <p>
      Lanoire searched his face for some crease of a lie. At this altitude,
      anything larger than rabbits were a rarity, and even those were hard to
      come by. The herds of Markhorein that lived in the mountains were elusive
      and kept to the highest, steepest cliffs of the Gokyo Ri, where they could
      easily disappear. Their descent marked the start of the Spring Ceremony
      every year.
    </p>
    <p>
      A flash of speartips swam through her memory, leonen jogging side-by-side
      through the snow. Maybe the tribe hadn’t gone looking for her brothers at
      all, but had been alerted to the early signs of the herds descent. The
      prospect of such a spectacular hunt made Lanoire’s heart thrill, but
      skepticism still gripped her.
    </p>
    <p>It was too good to be true.</p>
    <p>
      “I saw them,” Nasir continued. “Two of the biggest bulls I've ever seen,
      and a whole bunch of those golden kids. So little, I bet even you could
      catch one, Noire.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Lanoire pinned her ears at the jibe, but looked between her brothers all
      the same. She was supposed to be studying, but even if she wanted to, how
      could she stay indoors now? The mountains called to her like wind to a
      bird. She barely cast a look over the cool blue walls of the temple before
      slipping out of her robes and casting aside as many of the ceremonial
      jewels she wore as she could before running for the slender beams of
      daylight at the temples entrance, the pages of the discarded Panthera
      still blowing open.
    </p>
    <div className={style.comicPanel}>

    </div>
    <p>
      Against a near-obliterating backdrop of powdery white snow, it was easy to
      miss the outlines of three young leonen slinking along the ridgeline.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between the gray-brown streaks of granite and the spindly white birch and
      aspen trees that still clung on at this altitude, they were practically
      invisible. The air was thin as a razor blade, but Lanoire was glad to be
      running. Like her brothers, she relished in her own natural strength, and
      leapt down narrow crevasses in the mountain without as much as a second
      glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although her brothers were only a few minutes older than she was, they
      were much larger. Their dark gray baby fur replaced by the same glossy
      off-white coat shared by rest of her clade two springs ago.{" "}
    </p>
    <p>
      Against the snow her brothers were invisible, while Lanoire was forced to
      hesitate at each clearing. Unlike them, she was easy to spot out in the
      open, and could spook the herd if she moved too quickly. She dashed from
      boulder to boulder, crouching low against the rough rock face as sweeping
      gusts of wind threatened to toss her right over the edge.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Shouldn’t we go down?” she said in a voice barely above a whisper. “If
      the markhorein have gone into the valley, we wont see them from up here.”
      Nasir scented the air, flattening himself low against the snow as he
      picked up something on the breeze.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nothing hunts markhorein in these mountains,” he said, his voice
      tremulous with excitement. “If we stay above them, we have the element of
      surprise.”
    </p>
    <p>“How so?” said Lanoire.</p>
    <p>
      “They don’t live in the valley, they’ll return to the peaks eventually,”
      he said quietly. “And when they do, they’ll run right into us.”
    </p>
    <p>
      They edged along the rim, carefully picking out a path down the
      near-vertically slope of the canyon. If they could catch sight of the
      herd, it would simply be a matter of positioning to ensure they ran right
      into the beasts.
    </p>
    <p>
      With little vegetation able to conceal them on the cliffs, Lanoire felt
      every hair on the back of her neck standing up as she stepped out into the
      open. Nothing but snow surrounded them for miles. What little cover she
      did find was bracing against small footholds in the granite, flattening
      herself against the mountains when the wind picked up.{" "}
    </p>
    <p>
      It was slow going, Nasir picking a path through the snow. He was
      especially surefooted, his ringed tail balancing him against powerful
      gusts of wind as if he were merely on a stroll through the village. When
      they came to a dead end in the trail, Lanoire had to crawl on all fours to
      keep her footing, claws scratching for purchase.

        <strong>SCENE:</strong>
        Lanoire descends the steep cliffs of the Gokyo Ri

    <p>
      Suddenly, Nasir stopped, crouching low on a ledge only a little bigger
      than he was. Lanoire and Sabin followed suit as he pointed to a shady
      crease in the mountains where a herd of some ten Markhorein stood pulling
      thick yellow reeds from the still knee-deep snow. They were guarded by a
      large male with a rack of spiraling black antlers and a tan mane, flit
      with gray, running down his throat.
    </p>
    <p>Nasir scanned the herd. “Look at the size of that bull.”</p>
    <p>
      Lanoire frowned. The male was larger than the wild horses that roamed the
      edges of the Black Forest, with a huge rack of spiraling antlers as large
      as the animal itself. She put a handpaw on her brothers shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>“How will we get him out of here? It’s just the three of us?” </p>
    <p>“Which one, then?” </p>
    <p>
      Lanoire scanned the herd thoughtfully. There were two females with young
      kids by their side and a gang of scrawny yearlings. Lanoire pointed at one
      of the older females, a hash of silver scars already emblazoned into her
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>“That one.”</p>

    <p>
      Nasir scowled, but licked his lips all the same. It would be difficult to
      get aligned with the herd without losing their vantage point behind
      snowdrifts, but if they snaked along the curve of the rim, they would be
      right on top of them — then, all there is to do is wait.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lanoire struck out along the cliffside, her eyes trained on the
      Markhorein. The herd grazed quietly in the valley below them, completely
      unaware of the leonen. One of them looked up abruptly, making them all
      freeze, but it was staring in the opposite direction, its round ears
      twitching at a sound carrying on the wind.{" "}
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as they got close enough to the ledge to make out the herd in detail,
      a loud bang ricocheted off the Gokyo Ri and the snow under Lanoire’s
      footpaws give way. Before she could do anything to stop it, she went
      careening over the cliff in a spray of snow. She thought she saw something
      glinting on the other side of the canyon, but just then, her head hit a
      rock and she went crashing into the ravine, her brothers startled faces
      the last thing she remembered as everything disappeared behind her.
